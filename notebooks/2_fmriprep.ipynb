    "- **BIDS compatibility**: fMRIPrep can directly process data organized in accordance with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format.\n",
    "- **Ease of use**: fMRIPrep is easy to install and provides a unified command line interface.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Every step of the preprocessing pipeline is recorded, promoting reproducibility of the analysis.\n",
    "- **Transparent preprocessing**: Many visual reports are produced, allowing for easy quality control."
